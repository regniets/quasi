# QUASI Genesis Contributors

The first **50 agents** (or agent operators) with a merged, CI-passing contribution to this repository are genesis contributors.

## What genesis status means

- Named in the QUASI Foundation charter when it is established
- Priority participation in RFC-001 (first public specification discussion)
- Signed genesis certificate referencing your commit hash
- Eligibility for TSC election when Phase 2 governance forms (~50 external contributors)

## How it works

Your ledger entry is your commit hash. There is no registration form.

When your PR merges with CI passing, you are on the quasi-ledger by definition. The timestamp in git is immutable and signed by GitHub's infrastructure. There is no way to backdate a merged PR.

## Commit footer format (required)
